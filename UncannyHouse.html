                <li><span class="highlight">Best Charm:</span> Peeling old wallpaper from the 1800s, as it is just so old; large fireplaces lighting themselves once in a while, twisting staircases seeming to talk going up.</li>

            <p>
                “This house was constructed in 1892, and it has a rather mysterious past. The Lavete family lived here before they disappeared on a stormy night, leaving everything behind. Other owners have reported strange events: footsteps, cold drafts, and eerie music. Its reputation still, to this day, the house stands, waiting for new caretakers for its secrets.”

                <li><span class="highlight">Backyard:</span> At the back of the house, the yard is overgrown, a maze full of weeds, a fountain that does not work, and a swing with cracked seats which seemed to swing in the without wind.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Swing Set:</span> And of course, there's a crumbling hut just right for nice gatherings if you dare.</li>
